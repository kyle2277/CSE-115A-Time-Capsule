<h3> A <i> what </i> capsule? &#127776;</h3>
<p> Yep, you heard right the first time – this is a voice capsule app. It acts like a time capsule, but instead of storing photos, socks and vintage iPods, it stores <b> voice notes. </b> </p>
<p> These can be sent to yourself or to friends and it can only be opened on a specified date in the future. </p>
<h3> What kind of voice notes?</h3>
<p> This is open to the user’s creativity. It could be anything from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reminders of an upcoming homework deadline</li>
  <li>A happy birthday message for a friend</li>
  <li>A message declaring deep friendship and love </li>
</ul>
<h3> Why would this be useful? &#127793</h3>
<p> We exist on this planet for a limited period and we all know just how strange <i>time</i> is. This app serves a very human need to link ourselves to our past selves – and to our old friendships. Audio from the past is magical and knowing that we have an unexpected message to listen to in an upcoming day can make us look forward to the time we have ahead. &#127776;</p>
<h3> Open to construction &#127974; </h3>
<p> There are some important things we’d need to collectively agree on: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>How do we make the app safe and secure?</b> – We want it to be safe from abuse, trolling and harmful content.</li>
  <li><b>Maximum length of the voice notes?</b> - Would 5 minutes be enough? Or is 10 a better number?</li>
  <li><b> Who constitutes a friend</b> - It would be great if we could enlist an API to guarantee that people sending voice notes to each other actually do know one another. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Visuals &#128171;</h3>
<p> We want the app to look good! We want a calming, easy to navigate interface, which makes users appreciate audio from the past and human connection even more than they already do. </p>
<h3>Team Meetings</h3>
<p> We have three SCRUM stand-up meetings a week via Zoom. We also endeavour to meet once a week in person. </p>
<p> Our team is characterized by team-mates who like to <b> collaborate</b>, <b>learn loads </b>, and <b>have fun! </b></p>
